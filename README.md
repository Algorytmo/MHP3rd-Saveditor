- You can now see your money, bag items and quantity; 
- Clicking on button **Add Max Money**, money will be capped at 9999999;
- Double click on item quantity to edit it (max 99);
- Double click on item name (or in an empty slot) to choose another item;
- When you're done, click on **Save Changes** button and confirm; the tool will pack everything and encrypt all again;
- When all windows will close, put your new savedata again in memorystick folder and start the game.
